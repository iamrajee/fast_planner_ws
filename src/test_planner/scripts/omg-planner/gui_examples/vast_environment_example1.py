# This example is very similar to p2p_multiframeproblem.py, and uses the same principles
# The difference is that in the current example, a GUI is used to assist the user in building up
# the desired environment. For an explanation about how to use the GUI, see below.

from omgtools import *

# create vehicle
vehicle = Holonomic(shapes = Circle(radius=0.5), options={'syslimit': 'norm_2'},
                    bounds={'vmax': 1.2, 'vmin':-1.2, 'amax':10, 'amin':-10})
veh_size = vehicle.shapes[0].radius

# create environment with the help of a GUI

####### how to use the GUI? #########
#####################################
# create obstacles:
# -) select the shape of the obstacle you want to place (Circle or Rectangle)
# -) set the size of this shape (width, height for Rectangle, radius for Circle)
# -) set the x- and y-velocity if the obstacle is moving
# -) check Bounce if you want the moving obstacle to bounce off other obstacles or off the wall
# -) click at the desired position in the grid
# obstacles are automatically placed such that their center corresponds to the intersection of 4 cells

# select start and goal:
# start = right click somewhere in the grid
# goal = right click again
# if you made a mistake you can again click two times to make a new start and goal

# buttons:
# -) the Remove button removes the obstacle which was placed most recently
# clicking this button multiple times removes more obstacles, in the reverse order
# of their creation (starting with the obstacle which was created most recently)
# -) the Save checkmark lets you save the current environment, in the file environment.pickle
# -) the Load button loads the most recently saved environment
# -) the Quit button closes the GUI and stops the example
# -) the Ready button closes the GUI and continues the example,
# by extracting your created environment from the GUI
# -) the LoadSVG button lets you load in an environment which is defined inside an SVG
# when loading an svg, the GUI asks how many pixels there are in 1m e.g. '10',
# and how many cells you like horizontally and vertically e.g. '20,20'
# the loaded obstacles are all stationary, but after loading an svg, you can manually add extra (moving) obstacles
# for drawing.svg use e.g. 25 pixels/m and 30,30 cells
# for maze_small.svg use e.g. 5 pixels/m and 30,30 cells
# for maze_big.svg use e.g. 2 pixels/m and 100,100 cells (consider raising vehicle velocity limits to speed up)
# -) at the far right and below the Save checkmark there are arrows, to scroll through the grid

# Note: LoadSVG only works for a limited type of svg-files for the moment, consisting of
# line, polyline, rect or circle objects

# Note: to run this example just click Load in the GUI and select vast_environment_example1.pickle

# 'frame_type': 'shift': creates frames of fixed size, around the vehicle
